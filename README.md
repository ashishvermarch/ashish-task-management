Hi, This is Ashish Verma

- You will get the zip file.

Steps to open the code into local -
1- Right click on folder and click on "Extract here".
2- After new folder has been made, open it and open the folder's content into vs code.
3- open terminal
4- npm i
5- npm run dev
6- Your server will be running on http://localhost:3000/

I have made this application as optimised as possible, worked on performance optimization - using useReducer, usign debouncing for search, dividing the components into relevant chunks.

- Implemented server side rendering
- Implemented data persistance using local storage.
- Given color, made responsive.

I have also deployed this application to the vercel domain, you can access it by cliking on this link - https://ashish-task-management.vercel.app/

Please feel free to reach out in any case.
Thanks and regards
